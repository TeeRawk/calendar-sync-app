# Duplicate Resolution Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides comprehensive duplicate resolution logic for calendar sync operations. It efficiently identifies and handles duplicate meetings using multiple matching criteria and sophisticated confidence scoring.

## Key Components

### 1. DuplicateResolver Class (`lib/duplicate-resolution.ts`)

The main class that handles duplicate detection with configurable options:

- **Multi-criteria matching**: UID, time, title, and location matching
- **Confidence scoring**: 0-1 scale with configurable thresholds
- **Fuzzy string matching**: Levenshtein distance for title similarity
- **Time tolerance**: Configurable tolerance for start/end times
- **Performance optimized**: Limits comparisons and uses early exit strategies

### 2. Enhanced Sync Service (`lib/sync-service.ts`)

Updated the existing sync logic to integrate duplicate resolution:

- **Batch processing**: Processes events in batches of 5 for performance
- **Advanced logging**: Tracks duplicate resolution metrics
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback to creation on resolution errors
- **Metrics tracking**: Enhanced SyncResult with duplicate-specific counters

### 3. Key Features

#### Duplicate Detection Criteria

1. **UID Matching (40% weight)**:
   - Exact UID match in event descriptions
   - Base UID matching for recurring events
   - Handles timestamp suffixes in UIDs

2. **Time Matching (30% weight)**:
   - Configurable time tolerance (default: 10 minutes for sync)
   - Compares both start and end times
   - Accounts for timezone differences

3. **Title Matching (20% weight)**:
   - Exact match after normalization
   - Fuzzy matching with 85% similarity threshold
   - Case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized

4. **Location Matching (10% weight)**:
   - Exact location matching
   - Handles empty/null locations appropriately

#### Configuration Options

```typescript
interface DuplicateDetectionOptions {
  timeTolerance: number;        // Minutes of tolerance for time matching
  fuzzyMatching: boolean;       // Enable fuzzy string matching
  confidenceThreshold: number;  // Minimum confidence for duplicates (0-1)
  maxComparisons: number;       // Maximum existing events to compare
}
```

#### Enhanced Sync Results

```typescript
interface SyncResult {
  success: boolean;
  eventsProcessed: number;
  eventsCreated: number;
  eventsUpdated: number;
  eventsSkipped: number;       // NEW: Skipped due to duplicates
  duplicatesResolved: number;  // NEW: Successfully resolved duplicates
  errors: string[];
  duration: number;
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Early Exit**: Stops comparison at 95% confidence match
2. **Batch Processing**: Processes 5 events simultaneously
3. **Limited Comparisons**: Default max of 1000 existing events
4. **Error Resilience**: Falls back to creation on API errors
5. **Efficient Queries**: Uses Google Calendar API pagination

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createDuplicateResolver } from './lib/duplicate-resolution';

const resolver = createDuplicateResolver({
  timeTolerance: 5,
  confidenceThreshold: 0.8
});

const result = await resolver.findDuplicateMeeting(
  incomingEvent,
  calendarId,
  startDate,
  endDate
);

if (result.isDuplicate) {
  // Update existing event
  await updateGoogleCalendarEvent(calendarId, result.existingEventId, event);
} else {
  // Create new event
  await createGoogleCalendarEvent(calendarId, event);
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```typescript
const resolver = createDuplicateResolver({
  timeTolerance: 15,        // 15 minute tolerance
  fuzzyMatching: true,      // Enable fuzzy matching
  confidenceThreshold: 0.75, // Lower threshold for more matches
  maxComparisons: 500       // Limit for performance
});
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites have been implemented:

### Unit Tests (`__tests__/unit/lib/duplicate-resolution.test.ts`)

- Tests all matching criteria individually
- Tests confidence calculation logic
- Tests string similarity algorithms
- Tests error handling scenarios
- Tests edge cases and boundary conditions

### Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/duplicate-resolution-e2e.test.ts`)

- End-to-end sync scenarios with mixed event types
- Performance testing with large event sets
- Error recovery testing
- Concurrent operation testing
- Data consistency verification

## Logging and Monitoring

Enhanced logging provides visibility into duplicate resolution:

```
üîç Checking for duplicates: "Team Meeting"
üìä Comparing against 45 existing events
üéØ Duplicate analysis for "Team Meeting": update (confidence: 89%) - UID match: Base UID match: team-meeting-uid; Time match: Time within 10min tolerance
üîÑ Updating existing event: Team Meeting (ID: existing-google-event-123)
üìä Sync completed with duplicate resolution:
  ‚Ä¢ Events processed: 10
  ‚Ä¢ Events created: 5
  ‚Ä¢ Events updated: 3
  ‚Ä¢ Duplicates resolved: 3
  ‚Ä¢ Events skipped: 2
  ‚Ä¢ Duration: 2500ms
```

## Database Schema Impact

The implementation is designed to work with the existing database schema without requiring new tables. It leverages:

- Existing `syncLogs` table for enhanced metrics
- Google Calendar descriptions for UID tracking
- No additional database queries required

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All event data is validated before processing
2. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses Drizzle ORM parameterized queries
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respects Google Calendar API limits with delays
4. **Error Containment**: Errors in duplicate resolution don't break sync

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Machine Learning**: Train ML models on user behavior patterns
2. **Persistence**: Store duplicate resolution history in database
3. **User Feedback**: Allow users to confirm/deny duplicate matches
4. **Analytics**: Detailed reporting on duplicate resolution effectiveness
5. **Cross-Calendar**: Detect duplicates across multiple calendars

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, efficient, and maintainable solution for duplicate resolution in calendar sync operations. It balances accuracy with performance while providing comprehensive logging and error handling capabilities.
