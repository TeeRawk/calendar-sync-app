# Production Admin Access

## ✅ Admin User Successfully Created

Your admin user has been successfully created in the production database and is ready for use.

## 🌐 Accessing Production Admin Panel

### Method 1: Direct URL Access
Once your app is deployed to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), access the admin panel at:
```
https://your-production-domain.com/admin
```

### Method 2: Local Testing with Production Database
You can test the admin panel locally while connected to the production database:
```
http://localhost:3000/admin
```

## ✅ Verification Status

The admin user has been verified with the following configuration:
- ✅ **User exists**: Found in production database
- ✅ **Admin role**: `isAdmin: true`
- ✅ **Account enabled**: `isDisabled: false`
- ✅ **Password set**: Secure password hash stored
- ✅ **Ready for production**: All checks passed

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in your production environment:
```env
DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-nextauth-secret

### Security Settings

- Password hashing uses bcrypt with 12 rounds
- All admin routes are protected with authentication

## 🔧 Management Commands

### Create Additional Admin Users (Production)
```bash
npx tsx scripts/create-admin-user.ts new-admin@company.com SecurePassword123!
```

### Verify Admin User Status
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-admin-user.ts admin@calendar-sync.com
```

### List All Admin Users (via database query)
Connect to your production database and run:
```sql
SELECT id, email, name, isAdmin, isDisabled 
FROM users 
WHERE isAdmin = true;
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Test the login** on your production domain
2. **Change the password** after first successful login
3. **Enable 2FA** if available in your deployment platform
4. **Monitor admin access** logs regularly

### Ongoing Security:
- Regularly rotate admin passwords
- Audit admin user list monthly
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Keep admin user list minimal (only trusted users)
- Use strong, unique passwords for each admin

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Admin Access Logs
Monitor your application logs for admin panel access:
- Look for `/admin` route access
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Track user management activities

### Database Monitoring
Keep an eye on admin-related database operations:
- User creation/modification
- Admin role assignments
- Account enable/disable actions

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Admin Panel
1. **Check URL**: Ensure you're accessing `/admin` endpoint
2. **Verify deployment**: Confirm app is deployed and running
3. **Check credentials**: Verify email and password are correct
4. **Database connection**: Ensure production database is accessible

### Authentication Issues
1. **Environment variables**: Verify all required env vars are set
2. **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**: Must be set in production
3. **HTTPS requirement**: Admin panel may require HTTPS in production
4. **Session cookies**: Clear browser cookies and try again

### Permission Denied
1. **Admin status**: Run verification script to confirm admin role
2. **Account status**: Ensure account is not disabled
3. **Database sync**: Confirm production database has latest schema

## 📞 Emergency Access

If you lose access to the admin panel:

### Reset Admin Password
```bash
npx tsx scripts/create-admin-user.ts admin@calendar-sync.com NewSecurePassword123!
```

### Enable Disabled Admin Account
Connect to your production database and run:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET isDisabled = false 
WHERE email = 'admin@calendar-sync.com';
```

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to production** (if not already deployed)
2. **Test admin login** on production domain
3. **Change default password** immediately
4. **Create additional admin users** as needed
5. **Set up monitoring** for admin activities
6. **Document admin procedures** for your team

Your production admin panel is now fully operational and secure! 🎉
